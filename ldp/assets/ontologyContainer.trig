An archaeological excavation typically takes place in a predefined geographic area specifically defined after an investigation campaign or based on interpretation of sources, or evidenced by a different activity (such as: preparatory works for urban construction, rescue archaeology and similar) and is carried out according with specific authorisations provided by a competent authority. A specific identifier for each archaeological excavation is usually assigned by the same authority. The set of activities is not limited to matter removals but also comprises siblings activities, happening throughout the whole process, intended for observation and/or consolidation of the excavated strata. The archaeological excavation is usually under the responsibility of a coordinator, officially designated, which is legally and scientifically responsible for all the activities carried out within each of the excavation process units and is also responsible for the documentation of the whole process."@en .

    rdfs:comment """This class comprises activities of excavating in the sense of archaeology which are documented as a coherent set of actions of progressively recording and removing matter from a pre-specified location under specific rules. Typically, an excavation process unit would be terminated if significant discontinuities of substance or finds come to light, or if the activity should be interrupted due to external factors, such as end of a working day. In other cases, the termination would be based on predefined physical specifications, such as the boundaries of a maximal volume of matter intended to be excavated in one unit of excavation.
Depending on the methodology, an instance of A1 Excavation Process Unit may intend to remove matter only within the boundaries of a particular stratigraphic unit, or it may follow a pre-declared spatial extent such as a trench. It may only uncover, clean or expose a structure or parts of it.
The process of excavation results in the production of a set of recorded (documentation) data that should be sufficient to provide researchers enough information regarding the consistence and spatial distribution of the excavated Segment of Matter and things and features embedded in it. Some parts or all of the removed physical material (S11 Amount of Matter) may be dispersed, whereas others may be kept in custody in the form of finds or samples, while others (such as parts of walls) may be left at the place of their discovery. The data produced by an instance of excavation process unit should pertain to the material state of matter at excavation time only and should well be distinguished from subsequent interpretation about the causes for this state of matter.

Normally, an embedding is expected having been stable from the time of generation on of the first A2 Stratigraphic Volume Unit that surrounds it. However, it may also be due to later intrusion. As an empirical fact, the expert may only be able to decide that a particular embedding is not recent, i.e., has been persisting for longer than the activity that encountered it. This class can be used to document the fact of embedding generally with respect to the surrounding matter or more specifically with respect to a more precise position within this matter.

One genesis event may have created more than one SU.

Normally at least one of the surfaces (such as the lower one) from its genesis event will remain during its existence.
This also implies that a certain degree of coherent (“conformal”) deformation is tolerable within its time-span of existence. Therefore the place an instance of A8 Stratigraphic Unit occupies can be uniquely identified with respect to the surrounding reference space of archaeological interest.

The recording of the donor and/or recipient is optional. It is possible that in an instance of E8 Acquisition there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:
1.	the beginning of ownership

It may also describe events where a collector appropriates legal title, for example by annexation or field collection.

The CRM therefore models legal ownership (E8 Acquisition) and physical custody (E10 Transfer of Custody) separately.

  crm:E4_Period rdfs:comment """This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.

It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the \"ground\" or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.

Often, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the \"Neolithic Period\", the \"Ming Dynasty\" or the \"McCarthy Era\", but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.

As the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.

Whether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.

Consequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the  timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least  one area.

We model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while a space-time volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.

There are two different conceptualisations of `artistic style`, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.

Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.

An instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a number of individually contiguous spacetime volumes equal to the number of unconnected objects that constitute the set.

This class includes the production of an item from raw materials, and other so far undocumented objects, and the preventive treatment or restoration of an object for conservation.
Since the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in a Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities.
If the instance of the E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.

Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object.

For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.

Discrete pieces of raw-materials kept in museums, such as bricks, sheets of fabric, pieces of metal, should be modelled individually in the same way as other objects. Discrete used or processed pieces, such as the stones from Nefer Titi`s temple, should be modelled as parts (cf. P46 is composed of).

An instance of E54 Dimension represents the true quantity, independent from its numerical approximation, e.g. in inches or in cm. The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the true values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that interoperability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.
Numerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension as appropriate.

The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.
 It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a \"section\" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination."""@en .

They can be repeatedly recognized within the duration of their existence by identity criteria rather than by continuity or observation. Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names.
The criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. The class E77 Persistent Item does not take any position about the nature of the applicable identity criteria and if actual knowledge about identity of an instance of this class exists. There may be cases, where the identity of an E77 Persistent Item is not decidable by a certain state of knowledge.
The main classes of objects that fall outside the scope the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. """@en .

Component elements, since they are themselves instances of E18 Physical Thing, may be further analysed into sub-components, thereby creating a hierarchy of part decomposition. An instance of E18 Physical Thing may be shared between multiple wholes, for example two buildings may share a common wall. This property does not specify when and for how long a component element resided in the respective whole. If  a component is not part of a whole from the beginning of existence or until the end of existence of the whole, the classes E79 Part Addition and E90 Part Removal can be used to document when a component became part of a particular whole and/or when it stopped being a part of it.

This property makes it possible to recognise the autonomous status of the incorporated signs, which were created in a distinct context, and can be incorporated in many distinct self-contained expressions, and to highlight the difference between structural and accidental whole-part relationships between conceptual entities.
It accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc.
In particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.

This allows you to describe the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. In the case of an E26 Physical Feature the default reference space is the one in which the object that bears the feature or at least the surrounding matter of the feature is at rest. In this case there is a 1:1 relation of E26 Feature and E53 Place. For simplicity of implementation multiple inheritance (E26 Feature IsA E53 Place) may be a practical approach.

For instances of E19 Physical Objects the default reference space is the one which is at rest to the object itself, i.e. which moves together with the object. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces.

This property is a subproperty of P161 has spatial projection because it refers to its own domain as reference space for its range, whereas P161 has spatial projection may refer to a place in terms of any reference space. For some instances of E18 Physical Object the relative stability of form may not be sufficient to define a useful local reference space, for instance for an amoeba. In such cases the fully developed path to an external reference space and using a temporal validity component may be adequate to determine the place they have occupied.

In contrast to P156  occupies, the property P53 has former or current location identifies an instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time span.  Further it does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of P53 Place.

It is the space in which we typically expect things to stay in place if no particular natural or human distortion processes occur. This definition requires that at least essential parts of the respective physical thing have a stability of form. The degree of this stability (e.g., elastic deformation of a ship on sea, landslides, geological deformations) limits the precision to which an instance of SP3 Reference Space is defined. It is possible to construct types of (non Euclidian) reference spaces which adapt to elastic deformations or have other geometric and dynamic properties to adapt to changes of form of the reference object, but they are of rare utility in the cultural-historical discourse.

An instance of SP3 Reference Space begins to exist with the largest thing that is at rest in it and ceases to exist with its E6 Destruction[ØE12].

  crmgeo:SP11_Temporal_Reference_System rdfs:comment """Scope note:	This class compromises systems(S) that are used to describe positions and extents in a Reference Time. If relativistic effects are negligible in the wider spacetime area of interest and the speeds of associated things, then there is only one unique global reference time. The typical way to measure time is to count the cycles of a periodic process for which we have a hypothesis of constant frequency, such as oscillations of a crystal, molecular arrangement, rotation of earth around itself or around the sun. The origin for a Temporal Reference System is fixed on a reference event. As long as the number of cycles passed from that reference event until now are known, the temporal reference system exists (E) and expressions in this Reference System can be interpreted with respect to the Reference Time. 
A temporal reference system represents time as a continuous linear interpolation over the infinit series of cycles extended from the reference event to he past and the future, regardless of the temporal position of the mathematical point zero of an instance of E61 Time Primitive, such for instance the gregorian calender begins with the event an arbitrary positiong the point zero as beeing the date of the „Birth of Christ“. The actual date of birth of christ is regarded to be unknown and therefor is not the reference event. 
The identity of a Temporal Reference System is defined through the type of periodic process it is based on, the reference event and through the distance of the reference event to the position of the mathematical point zero (I).
A value in the Reference Time is a temporal position measured relative to a temporal reference system. ISO 8601 specifies the use of the Gregorian Calendar and 24 hour local or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for information interchange. 
In ISO 19108 three common types of temporal reference systems are explicitly stated: calendars (used with clocks for greater resolution), temporal coordinate systems, and ordinal temporal reference systems. 
Calendars and clocks are both based on interval scales. A calendar is a discrete temporal reference system that provides a basis for defining temporal position to a resolution of one day. A clock provides a basis for defining temporal position within a day. A clock must be used with a calendar in order to provide a complete description of a temporal position within a specific day. Every calendar provides a set of rules for composing a calendar date from a set of elements such as year, month, and day. In every calendar, years are numbered relative to the date of a reference event that defines a calendar era [ISO 19108].
Specifying temporal position in terms of calendar date and time of day complicates the computation of distances between points and the functional description of temporal operations. A temporal coordinate system may be used to support applications of this kind. [ISO 19108].
Ordinal temporal reference systems as specified in ISO 19108 are no instances of SP11 Temporal Reference Systems as they do not define cycles of a periodic process but define a system of time intervals based on reverence periods related to certain natural or cultural phenomena. 
Examples:  
•	Gregorian Calendar
•	Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) 
•	Julian date
•	Greenwich time

The spatial projection depends on the instance of S3 Reference Space onto which the extent of the phenomenon is projected. In general, there are no limitations to the number of Reference Spaces one could regard, but only few choices are relevant for the cultural-historical discourse. Typical for the archaeological discourse is to choose a reference space with respect to which the remains of some events would stay at the same place, for instance, relative to the bedrock of a continental plate. On the other side, for the citizenship of babies born in aeroplanes, the space in which the boundaries of the overflown state are defined may be relevant (I). Instances of SP2 Phenomenal Place exist as long as the respective reference space is defined. Note that we can talk in particular about what was at a place in a country before a city was built there, i.e., before the time the event occurred by which the place is defined, but we cannot talk about the place of earth before it came into existence due to lack of a reasonable reference space (E).

A Spacetime Volume Expression defines a SP7 Declarative Spacetime Volume, which means that the identity of the Spacetime Volume is derived from its geometric and temporal definition. This declarative Spacetime Volume allows for the application of all Spacetime Volume properties to relate phenomenal Spacetime Volumes of Periods and Physical Things to propositions about their spatial and temporal extents.

  crmgeo:SP1_Phenomenal_Spacetime_Volume rdfs:comment """Scope note: This class comprises the 4 dimensional point sets (volumes) (S) which material phenomena (I) occupy in Space-Time (S). An instance of S1 Space Time Volume represents the true (I) extent of an instance of E4 Period in spacetime or the true (I) extent of the trajectory of an instance of E18 Physical Thing during the course of its existence, from production to destruction. A fuzziness of the extent lies in the very nature of the phenomenon, and not in the shortcomings of observation (U). The degree of fuzziness with respect to the scale of the phenomenon may vary widely, but the extent is never exact in a mathematical sense. According to modern physics, points in space-time are absolute with respect to the physical phenomena happening at them, regardless the so-called Galilean relativity of spatial or temporal reference systems in terms of which an observer may describe them. Following the theory, points relative to different spatial or temporal reference systems can be related if common points of phenomena in space-time are known in different systems. Instances of S1 Space-Time Volume are sets of such absolute space-time points of phenomena (I).The (Einstein) relativity of spatial and temporal distances is of no concern for the scales of things in the cultural-historical discourse, but does not alter the above principles.[ØE8] The temporal projection of an instance of SP1 Space-Time Volume defines an E52 Time-Span while its spatial projection defines an SP2 Phenomenal Place[ØE9]. The true location of an instance of E18 Physical Thing during some time-span can be regarded as the spatial projection of the restriction of its trajectory to the respective time-span.
Examples:
• The Space Time Volume of the Event of Ceasars murdering
• The Space Time Volume where and when the carbon 14 dating of the \"Schoeninger Speer II\" in 1996 took place

An instance of SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference System is composed of two parts: The first is a Coordinate System which is a set of coordinate axes with specified units of measurement and axis directions. The second part is a set of reference features at rest in the Reference Space it describes in the real world that relate the Coordinate System to real world locations (U) and fix it with respect to the reference object of its Reference Space .
In surveying and geodesy, instance of SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference System are called a datum. In the case of spatial coordinate reference systems for the earth the datum consists of the reference points and an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the earth. National systems often use ellipsoids that approximate their territory best and shift them in an appropriate position relative to the earth while WGS84 is an ellipsoid for the whole earth and used in GPS receivers. In engineering a datum is a reference feature of an object used to create a reference system for measurement.The set of reference features in the real world are subset of E26 Physical Feature that are within the described reference space at rest and pertain to the E18 Physical Thing the reference space is at rest with.
SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference Systems have a validity for a certain spatial extent of the SP3 Reference Space and in addition a temporal validity. The combination of coordinate reference system and datum provides a unique identity (I). SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference Systems may be defined for the earth, moving objects like planes or ships, linear features like boreholes or local systems. If there is a standardised identifier system available, such as EPSG codes, it should be used.

            This class comprises instances of E2 Temporal Entity or E77 Persistent Item, i.e. items or phenomena that can be observed, either directly by human sensory impression, or enhanced with tools and measurement devices, such as physical things, their behavior, states and interactions or events.
Conceptual objects can be present in events by their carriers such as books, digital media, or even human memory. By virtue of this presence, properties of conceptual objects, such as number of words can be observed on their carriers. If the respective properties between carriers differ, either they carry different instances of conceptual objects or the difference can be attributed to accidental deficiencies in one of the carriers. In that sense even immaterial objects are observable. By this model we give credit to the fact that frequently, the actually observed carriers of conceptual objects are not explicitly identified in documentation, i.e., the actual carrier is assumed having existed but is unknown as an individual.

            This class comprises identifiable features that are physically attached in an integral way to particular physical objects. An instance of S20 Physical Feature also represents the place it occupies with respect to the surrounding matter. More precisely, it is the maximal real volume in space that an instance of S20 Physical Feature is occupying during its lifetime with respect to the default reference space relative to which the feature is at rest. In cases of features on or in the surface of earth, the default reference is typically fixed to the closer environment of the tectonic plate or sea floor. In cases of features on mobile objects, the reference space is typically fixed to the geometry of the bearing object.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colors, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.
This definition coincides with the definition of \"fiat objects\" (Smith and Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects”.

            This class comprises physical material in a relative stability of form (substance) within a specific spacetime volume (unity, extend). The spatial extend of a S22 Segment of Matter is defined by humans usually because the constellation is subject to a specific interest for and investigations of the geometric arrangement of physical features or parts of them on or within the specified S22 Segment of Matter. It comes into existence as being an object of discourse through S4 Observation or declaration and is restricted to the time span starting after the last change through an S18 Alteration before the S4 Observation or declaration and ending with the next S18 Alteration Event (identity). A S22 Segment of Matter exists as long as there is no modification of the geometric arrangement of its particles. Therefore the temporal boundaries of the defining Spacetime Volume are given by two S18 Alteration events.
            The history of a S22 Segment of Matter started with the first S17 Physical Genesis event that deposited still existing matter within the defined spatial extend. The collection of all S18 Alteration events represent its history. Some of the events will not leave any physical material within the S22 Segment of Matter.

            This class comprises activities of S4 Observation (substance) where an E39 Actor encounters an instance of E18 Physical Thing of a kind relevant for the mission of the observation or regarded as potentially relevant for some community (identity). This observation produces knowledge about the existence of the respective thing at a particular place in or on surrounding matter. This knowledge may be new to the group of people the actor belongs to. In that case we would talk about a discovery. The observer may recognize or assign an individual identity of the thing encountered or regard only the type as noteworthy in the associated documentation or report.
In archaeology there is a particular interest if an object is found “in situ”, i.e. if its embedding in the surrounding matter supports the assumption that the object was not moved since the archaeologically relevant deposition event. The surrounding matter with the relative position of the object in it as well as the absolute position and time of the observation may be recorded in order to enable inferences about the history of the E18 Physical Thing.
In Biology, additional parameters may be recorded like the kind of ecosystem, if the biological individual survives the observation, what detection or catching devices have been used or if the encounter event supported the detection of a new biological kind (“taxon”).

  frbroo:F1_Work rdfs:comment """This class comprises distinct concepts or combinations of concepts identified in artistic and intellectual expressions, such as poems, stories or musical compositions. Such concepts may appear in the course of the coherent evolution of an original idea into one or more expressions that are dominated by the original idea. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously or over time. The substance of Work is ideas. A Work may have members that are works in their own right.
A Work can be either individual or complex. If it is individual its concept is completely realised in a single F22 Self-Contained Expression. If it is complex its concept is embedded in an F15 Complex Work. An F15 Complex Work consists of alternative members that are either F15 Complex Works themselves or F14 Individual Works. 
A Work is the product of an intellectual process of one or more persons, yet only indirect evidence about it is at our hands. This can be contextual information such as the existence of an order for a work, reflections of the creators themselves that are documented somewhere, and finally the expressions of the work created. As ideas normally take shape during discussion, elaboration and implementation, it is not reasonable to assume that a work starts with a complete concept. In some cases, it can be very difficult or impossible to define the whole of the concept of a work at a particular time. The objective evidence for such a notion can only be based on a stage of expressions at a given time. In this sense, the sets of ideas that constitute  particular self-contained expressions may be regarded as a kind of “snap-shot” of a work.
A Work may include the concept of aggregating expressions of other works into a new expression. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.

There is no other semantic implication to this notion of being characteristic than to be an adequate candidate to uniquely identify the Work realized by it. Prototypically, this is the instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression that is deemed characteristic of an instance of F15 Complex Work.
Typically, any expression that is not regarded as “representative” for the work it expresses, would require a controlled access point, with qualifiers specifying the differences between that expression and a representative expression, although this may not always be done in practice. The title of a Work may not be one taken from a representative expression.
A given work can have more than one representative expression, provided the differences between these expressions are not deemed “substantial.” If the anticipated needs of users are not considered to call for bibliographic distinctions between variant expressions of a work, then even expressions that differ significantly from each other can be regarded as equally representative for the work. (See FRBR: Final Report, p. 19-20).
A given expression can be deemed representative for a work with regard to some of its aspects (e.g., the text contained in an edition the title proper of which reads ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’, and the language of that text), and not representative for it with regard to some other aspects (e.g., the title proper ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’ itself, which, being different from the title that is regarded as “representative” for Shakespeare’s work, will require the use of a controlled access point).
R40 has representative expression is a shortcut of the more developed path F1 Work R50i was assigned by F42 Representative Expression Assignment R51 assigned F2 Expression.

The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of immobile objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.
It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a section of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination. [Scope Note for E53 Place in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]

  frbroo:F8_Event rdfs:comment """This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space.
It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatio-temporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture.
Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the ‘Neolithic Period’, the ‘Ming Dynasty’ or the ‘McCarthy Era’. There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.
There are two different conceptualisations of “artistic style”, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, Impressionism can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.
Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.
[This is the Scope note for E4 Period in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]

The substance of F2 Expression is signs.
Expressions cannot exist without a physical carrier, but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. Carriers may include human memory.
Inasmuch as the form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression, any change in form (e.g., from alpha-numeric notation to spoken word, a poem created in capitals and rendered in lower case) is a new F2 Expression. Similarly, changes in the intellectual conventions or instruments that are employed to express a work (e.g., translation from one language to another) result in the creation of a new F2 Expression. Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the resulting F2 Expression is considered to be a new F2 Expression. Minor changes, such as corrections of spelling and punctuation, etc., are normally considered variations within the same F2 Expression. On a practical level, the degree to which distinctions are made between variant expressions of a work will depend to some extent on the nature of the F1 Work itself, and on the anticipated needs of users.
The genre of the work may provide an indication of which features are essential to the expression. In some cases, aspects of physical form, such as typeface and page layout, are not integral to the intellectual or artistic realisation of the work as such, and therefore are not distinctive criteria for the respective expressions. For another work, features such as layout may be essential. For instance, the author or a graphic designer may wrap a poem around an image.
An expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.
If an instance of F2 Expression is of a specific form, such as text, image, etc., it may be simultaneously instantiated in the specific classes representing these forms in CIDOC CRM. Thereby one can make use of the more specific properties of these classes, such as language (which is applicable to instances of E33 Linguistic Object only).

Although F2 Expression is an abstract entity, a conceptual object, the creation of an expression inevitably also affects the physical world: when you scribble the first draft of a poem on a sheet of paper, you produce an instance of F4 Manifestation Singleton; F28 Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the carrying E18 Physical Thing. The work becomes manifest by being expressed on a physical carrier different from the creator’s brain. The spatio-temporal circumstances under which the expression is created are necessarily the same spatio-temporal circumstances under which the first instance of F4 Manifestation Singleton is produced. The mechanisms through which oral tradition (of myths, tales, music, etc.) operates are not further investigated in this model. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only those instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s brain and the auditor’s brain are taken into account (for a discussion of the modelling of oral traditions, see: Nicolas, Yann. ‘Folklore Requirements for Bibliographic Records: oral traditions and FRBR.’ In: Cataloging Classification Quarterly (2005).

Electronic Publishing does not mean producing a physical instance of F5 Item by partially electronic means. Making an electronic file available on a physical carrier can be regarded as equivalent to setting up the means of production; downloading the file is regarded as the electronic equivalent of F32 Carrier Production Event.

An instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type is the “species”, and all copies of a given object are “specimens” of it. An instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type defines all of the features or traits that instances of F5 Item normally display in order that they may be recognised as copies of a particular publication. However, due to production problems or subsequent events, one or more instances of F5 Item may not exhibit all these features or traits; yet such instances still retain their relationship to the same instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type.
The features that characterise a given instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type include: one instance of F24 Publication Expression, containing one or more than one instance of F2 Expression, reflecting the authors’ content of the manifestation and all additional input by the publisher; and the appropriate types of physical features for that form of the object. For example, hardcover and paperback are two distinct publications (i.e. two distinct instances of F3 Manifestation Product Type) even though authorial and editorial content are otherwise identical in both publications. The activity of cataloguing aims at the most accurate listing of features or traits of an instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type that are sufficient to distinguish it from another instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type.

  frbroo:F22_Self-Contained_Expression rdfs:comment """This class comprises the immaterial realisations of individual works at a particular time that are regarded as a complete whole. The quality of wholeness reflects the intention of its creator that this expression should convey the concept of the work. Such a whole can in turn be part of a larger whole.
Inherent to the notion of work is the completion of recognisable outcomes of the work. These outcomes, i.e. the Self-Contained Expressions, are regarded as the symbolic equivalents of Individual Works, which form the atoms of a complex work. A Self-Contained Expression may contain expressions or parts of expressions from other work, such as citations or items collected in anthologies. Even though they are incorporated in the Self-Contained Expression, they are not regarded as becoming members of the expressed container work by their inclusion in the expression, but are rather regarded as foreign or referred to elements.
F22 Self-Contained Expression can be distinguished from F23 Expression Fragment in that an F23 Expression Fragment was not intended by its creator to make sense by itself. Normally creators would characterise an outcome of a work as finished. In other cases, one could recognise an outcome of a work as complete from the elaboration or logical coherence of its content, or if there is any historical knowledge about the creator deliberately or accidentally never finishing (completing) that particular expression. In all those cases, one would regard an expression as self-contained.

The instance of E39 Actor with which a work is associated through the chain of properties F1 Work R16i was initiated by F27 Work Conception P14 carried out by E39 Actor corresponds to the notion of the “creator” of the work. In the case of commissioned works, it is not the commissioning that is regarded as the work conception, but the acceptance of the commission.
This event does not always correlate with the date assigned in common library practice to the work, which is usually a later event (such as the date of completion of the first clean draft).
In addition, F27 Work Conception can serve to document the circumstances that surrounded the appearance of the original idea for a work, when these are known.

  frbroo:F21_Recording_Work rdfs:comment """This class comprises works that conceptualise the capturing of features of perdurants.

The characteristics of any other works recorded are distinct from those of the recording work itself. In the case where the recorded perdurant expresses some Work, the respective instance of F21 is also an F16 Container Work.
The concept of recording is not necessarily linked to the use of modern devices that allow for mechanical recording, such as tape recorders or cameras. However, in practice, library catalogues tend to regard as recordings only the products of such mechanical devices.
But the concept of recording is very much linked to the notion that there is something that is recorded. In general, photographs or animated images are not to be regarded as instances of F21 Recording Work just because of the use of the medium, but simply as instances of F1 Work (or F15 Complex Work).

  frbroo:F15_Complex_Work rdfs:comment """This class comprises works that have other works as members. The members of a Complex Work may constitute alternatives to, derivatives of, or self-contained components of other members of the same Complex Work.
In practice, no clear line can be drawn between parallel and subsequent processes in the evolution of a work. One part may not be finished when another is already revised. An initially monolithic work may be taken up and evolve in pieces. The member relationship of Work is based on the conceptual relationship, and should not be confused with the internal structural parts of an individual expression. The fact that an expression may contain parts from other work(s) does not make the expressed work complex. For instance, an anthology for which only one version exists is not a complex work.
The boundaries of a Complex Work have nothing to do with the value of the intellectual achievement but only with the dominance of a concept. Thus, derivations such as translations are regarded as belonging to the same Complex Work, even though in addition they constitute an Individual Work themselves. In contrast, a Work that significantly takes up and merges concepts of other works so that it is no longer dominated by the initial concept is regarded as a new work. In cataloguing practice, detailed rules are established prescribing which kinds of derivation should be regarded as crossing the boundaries of a complex work. Adaptation and derivation graphs allow the recognition of distinct sub-units, i.e. a complex work contained in a larger complex work.
As a Complex Work can be taken up by any creator who acquires the spirit of its concept, it is never finished in an absolute sense.

            This class comprises the action of making honest propositions and statements about particular states of affairs in reality or in possible realities or categorical descriptions of reality by using inferences from other statements based on hypotheses and any form of formal or informal logic. It includes evaluations, calculations, and interpretations based on mathematical formulations and propositions. 
	It is characterized by the use of an existing I2 Belief as the premise that together with a set of I3 Inference Logic draws a further I2 Belief as a conclusion.
	Documenting instances of I5 Inference Making primarily enables tracing the dependency of knowledge from conclusion to premise through subsequent inferences, possibly back to primary evidence, so that the range of influence of knowledge revision at any intermediate stage of complex inference chains on current convictions can be narrowed down by query. The explicit reference to the applied inference logic further allows scholars or scientists to assess if they can or would follow the documented argument. The class is not intended to promote the use of computationally decidable systems of logic as replacements of scholarly justifications of arguments, even though it allows for documenting the use of decidable logic, if that was deemed adequate for the problem at hand.  Principles of scholarly justifications of arguments are also regarded as kinds of inference logic.

            This class comprises the rules used as inputs to I5 Inference Making.
	In this context the term “logic” is used in the most general sense of the Greek term, and not in the mathematical sense only. Examples are the direct application of formal logic, mathematical theories and calculus, formal or informal default reasoning based on default values associated with categories, probabilistic reasoning based mathematical models and assumed or observed frequencies for certain categories, application of theoretical social models and comparisons with “cultural parallels”, etc. An instance of Inference Logic could also be a reference to the exact software release of a Bayesian reasoner, a rule such as “later layers are on top of earlier layers”, or even a term like “social intuition”, if this is scholarly acceptable. (after Doerr, Kritsotaki and Boutsika 2011). Indeed anything that is scientifically or academically acceptable as a method for drawing conclusions may be included for instance human pattern recognition.
	A particular instance of I3 Inference Logic would be the algorithm implemented in a particular revision of a software package.
	Instances of I3 Inference Logic not only comprise the method of reasoning, but also the set of categorical laws or axioms used in the argumentation. Often both are inextricably interwoven, for instance in a software implementation.

It may not be a set of people distinguished within a society by common characteristics, such as “politicians” “working class” etc. Concepts of influence on the latter should rather be regarded as statistical correlations."@en .
